=== Commit Strategy ===
Initially, clone the repository.

- Pull from the repository: 'git pull remote origin'
- create a new branch and checkout: 'git checkout -b <branch_name>
- develop your branch... commit often:
    'git status' # View a list of which files have been modified, from the previous HEAD
    'git diff'   # View a diff of all files between HEAD & changes
                 # Navigate with 'j,k' quit with 'q'
    'git add -A' # add all changes to the commit
    'git commit' # make commit
- Once done working on feature, merge back into master branch
    'git checkout master' # checkout the master branch
    'git pull remote origin' # pull the latest changes
    'git merge <branch_name>' # merge your branch into master, resolve any conflicts
    'git push remote origin' # update the remote repository
